# Notes
This was my final project for CSC 223, the project was to choose data sets from sites and organize it, seeing as I couldnt find a data set I liked (and couldnt use another data set someone else in the class used.) I decided to make my own based on convention data gathered over the years from the links below, assuming they still work at the time of veiwing
